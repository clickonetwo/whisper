#  Whisper: BLE text-based communication

This app facilitates close-proximity conversation
where one of the participants has difficulty speaking.

[ColorStripe](https://github.com/artemnovichkov/ColorStripe) application
designed by [@artemnovichkov](https://github.com/artemnovichkov),
described in his [blog post](https://blog.artemnovichkov.com/bluetooth-and-swiftui).
