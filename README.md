# Whisper: conversation without voice

The Whisper app facilitates conversation where one of the participants (called the _Whisperer_) has difficulty speaking but not hearing, and the other participants (called _Listeners_) can speak to the Whisperer.  The Whisperer “speaks” by typing, and the Listeners “hear” that typing in real time.
