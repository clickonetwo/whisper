# Whisper

Whisper is an app that allows someone who doesn’t speak aloud to participate in a spoken conversation with others who do. The *Whisperer* uses the app to type their part of the conversation. The *Listeners* use either the app or a browser to see what the Whisperer is saying. The Listeners speak their responses aloud to the Whisperer and to each other.

To learn how to use the app, visit [Instructions](instructions.md). For help, visit [Support](support.md).

## Privacy

[ClickOneTwo](https://clickonetwo.io) (the maker of Whisper) does not collect, store, or process any data about individuals who use its applications.

The contents of conversations held through Whisper are not stored *anywhere*, even on your local device. The Whisperer can copy and paste what they have typed in the app, but Listeners cannot copy any text that the Whisperer has typed.

The Whisper app and your browser (if used for listening) store your name and other preferences locally. This is so that you do not have to reenter your name and change your preferences every time you enter a conversation. If a single user switches among multiple devices, they can choose to securely share their name and other preferences among those devices.

Whisper collects and sends to its server the following diagnostic, device, user, and conversation identifier data.  None of this data is ever associated with any personally identifiable information, and none of it is ever used for any purpose except to resolve issues reported by users and to improve the app's behavior:

* Anonymous information about crashes and other errors that interrupt conversations in the Whisper app.
* Identifiers created by the app that are specific to the device, the user’s *profile* (name and other preferences), and conversations that the user creates. These identifiers are random strings of characters that are different for each device, user, and conversation.
* The most recent date/time that the app was launched, that the Whisperer started each conversation, and that each Listener listened to each conversation.
* The names used by the Whisperer and Listeners for each conversation (whether in the app or browser), and the name of each conversation. 

All identifiers created by the app, and all names entered by users, and all associated dates/times are purged from the Whisper server if the devices, users, and conversations they are associated with have not been used in over 18 months.
