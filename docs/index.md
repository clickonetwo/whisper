# Whisper

Whisper allows someone who canâ€™t speak to participate in a conversation with others who can.  The *whisperer* uses a iOS device to type their part of the conversation.  The *listeners* then see what the whisperer is saying on their own iOS devices.  The listeners then speak their responses to the whisperer and to each other.
