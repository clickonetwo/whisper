# Whisper

Whisper allows someone who canâ€™t speak to participate in a conversation with others who can.  The *whisperer* uses a iOS device to type their part of the conversation.  The *listeners* then see what the whisperer is saying on their own iOS devices.  The listeners then speak their responses to the whisperer and to each other.

## Quick Start ##

There are three easy steps to getting your first conversation started with Whisper:

1. Each participant installs Whisper from the app store onto their personal devices.
2. Each participant launches Whisper, allows it to use Bluetooth, and enters their name.
3. The whisperer then hits the Whisper button while the listeners all hit the Listen button.

After a few seconds, the status messages in the app will show that the listeners are listening to the whisperer, and that the whisperer is whispering to the listeners.  Whatever the whisperer types will be shown immediately to all the listeners.
