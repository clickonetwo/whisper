# Instructions

The Whisper app is available through the App Store on both iOS and macOS. Listeners without Apple devices can use a web browser for their half of the conversation (see **Listening on the Web** below).

## Quick Start ##

NOTE: these instructions are for using Whisper when all participants have Apple devices and are within earshot in one location. For set-up in other situations, instructions can be found [here](instructions.md).

1. Each participant installs Whisper from the app store onto their personal devices.
2. Each participant launches Whisper, allows it to use Bluetooth, and enters their name.
3. The whisperer then hits the Whisper button while the listeners all hit the Listen button.

After a few seconds, the status messages in the app will show that the listeners are listening to the whisperer, and that the whisperer is whispering to the listeners.  Whatever the whisperer types will be shown immediately to all the listeners.

**More instructions can be found [here](instructions.md).**



## Getting Started ##

1. Open the Whisper app on iOS or Mac desktop
2. Type in your name (you can choose whether your name is remembered from the last session in [Settings](#settings))
3. Choose whether to Whisper or Listen. The top row of buttons will keep you in the app. The lower row of buttons, marked with üåê, will take you the web version of Whisper.

There are three easy steps to getting your first conversation started with Whisper:

1. Each participant installs Whisper from the app store onto their personal devices.
2. Each participant launches Whisper, allows it to use Bluetooth, and enters their name.
3. The whisperer then hits the Whisper button while the listeners all hit the Listen button.

After a few seconds, the status messages in the app will show that the listeners are listening to the whisperer, and that the whisperer is whispering to the listeners.  Whatever the whisperer types will be shown immediately to all the listeners.
