# Instructions

The Whisper app is available through the App Store[\*\*](./index.md#acknowledgements) on both iOS and macOS. You must have the app in order to *whisper*. It's possible to *listen* on any device with a web browser (see [below](#via-received-link)).

## Quick Start ##

On your Apple device (iOS or macOS), follow these steps:

1. Install Whisper from the App Store.
2. Launch Whisper on your device.
3. Allow the app to use Bluetooth.
4. Enter your name and tap the "done" key (iOS) or the return key (macOS)
5. Two new buttons will appear: [Whisper](#how-to-whisper) and [Listen](#how-to-listen); your app is now set up and you can use either function.

## How to Whisper ##

After following the steps in [Quick Start](#quick-start) above:

1. Click the Whisper button
2. In the Whisper window, hit the button to share a link with your Listeners. This button looks like <img src="img/phone-share-link.png" alt="phone-share-link" style="zoom: 33%;" /> on an iPhone and like <img src="img/pad-share-link.png" alt="pad-share-link" style="zoom: 20%;" /> on an iPad or computer.
3. Use the share dialog that appears to send the link to someone (or multiple people) you would like to join the conversation, and have the recipients click on that link. (NOTE: Whenever one of your recipients listens via a link *for the first time*, you will get prompted to accept them into the conversation. Once you accept them, they are accepted for all time, and they will be able to see what you type.)
4. Start whispering, er, typing! (When you’re ready to stop, hit the Stop button in the upper right of the screen.)

The steps above use your *default* conversation, which is created when you first use the app and given the name “Conversation 1.” To create, rename, or delete your conversations, or to choose a different conversation to start, long-press on the Whisper button. This will bring up a window that shows all your conversations and allows you to manage them. Next to each conversation there is a mouth icon; click on the icon for the conversation you wish to start.

Each conversation keeps track of which Listeners you have previously approved to join it, and will let them back in without prompting you. Accepting a listener to one conversation does *not* accept the listener to any other conversations: you will always be prompted to accept when a Listener joins any conversation for the first time.

### Tips for whispering:

* Listeners will only be able to read whispers sent *after* they join. Listeners who join later will not see any of the prior conversation.
* While whispering, you have access to a set of [Whisperer controls](#whisperer-controls) that you can use to customize the app’s behavior while whispering. Any changes you make using these controls are remembered from one session to the next.
* When whispering to people very near you, you don't necessarily need them to connect via their devices. You can simply turn on the *Read Aloud* [Whisperer setting](#whisperer-controls) and the Listener(s) will hear your whispers whenever you type the return key.

## How to Listen ##

After following the steps in [Quick Start](#quick-start) above, there are two ways to join a conversation:

### via Received Link

1. Wait to receive a link (also known as a URL) from the Whisperer over text, email, AirDrop, or any other messaging format.
2. Click the link to open it:

   * If you have the app, you will automatically join that conversation in the app. If this is the very first time you have tried to join that conversation, you will first be shown the conversation name and the Whisperer’s name and asked if you want to join.

   * If you don't have the app, the link will open in your browser. You will be prompted with the conversation name and the Whisperer’s name and asked to confirm that you want to join the conversation.
3. Start listening, er, reading! (When you’re ready to stop, hit the Stop button in the upper right of the screen.)

### via Remembered Link (in-app only)

1. Long press on the *Listen* button. This will bring up a window showing all the conversations that you have ever joined, most-recently joined first.
2. Tap on the ear icon next to a conversation to join that conversation.
3. Start listening, er, reading! (When you’re ready to stop, hit the Stop button in the upper right of the screen.)

### Tips for listening: ###

1. Whisper is designed for conversations where everyone can hear, so you can speak aloud as normal. 
2. Be a good listener! Make sure to read everything the Whisperer sends so you're sure of what they're saying.
3. Don't speak *over* the Whisperer. Even though they're typing and you're using your voice, you're still interrupting if you talk while they're talking/typing. Remember: hearing people are wired to pay attention to spoken words. That means that, even with the best intentions on all sides, you will naturally drown out the Whisperer by interrupting aloud. When listening, be sure to pay attention to the typing sound that indicates the Whisperer is typing, and don’t talk while you hear it.
4. The average person can speak aloud a lot faster than they can type (especially if the typist has physical restrictions). Remind yourself that this affects the pace of the conversation. It may feel a little awkward (at least at first), but that's okay—awkwardness happens! And it's a very minor price to pay for being able to have full conversations with the Whisperer(s) in your life.

## Home Screen

The home screen of the Whisper app, shown whenever you launch, is what gives you access to all of the app’s functionality.  On the Home Screen, you will find the following controls:

- **Your Name** — This must be filled in in order to participate in conversations. The name you enter here will be shown to the other participants.
- **Whisper** — Tap this button to start whispering, as explained above in [How to Whisper](#how-to-whisper). If you long press on this button, a [Whisper Conversations](#whisper-conversations) window will open that allows you to create, edit, and delete conversations.
- **Listen** — Tap this button to rejoin the last conversation you were listening to. If you have never listened before, or if you long press this button, a [Listen Conversations](#listen-conversations) window will open that allows you to see and edit your past conversations, and to join a conversation for which you have received a link.
- **Favorites** — This opens an [Edit Favorites window](#edit-favorites-window) that allows you to create and edit favorite snippets of text. Full instructions for using favorites can be [found below](#favorites).
- **Settings** — On an iPhone or iPad, this takes you the Whisper settings in your Settings app.  On a Mac, this opens a Whisper Settings window.  All the possible settings are [described below](#settings).
- **How To Use** — Tap this button to open a web browser on the [instructions page](./instructions.html) you are reading right now.
- **About** — Tap this button to open a web browser on an [information page](./index.html) about the Whisper app.
- **Support** — Tap this button to open a web browser on a [support page](./support.html) for the Whisper app. In addition to a FAQ, this page provides a way to contact the Whisper development team.
- **Profile Sharing** — This button allows you to synchronize your Whisper app behavior on multiple devices, as described in the [next section](#user-profiles).
- **Larger Type** — This switch allows you to switch the home screen to using a larger type size. Turning it on will also make the [Whisper Conversations window](#whisper-conversations), the [Listen Conversations window](#listen-conversations), and the [Edit Favorites window](#edit-favorites-window) use larger type size.  This switch does *not* affect the type sizes used in the whisper or listen windows, because those windows have their own font size controls.
- **Version Number** — At the very bottom of the home screen there is a small version number, such as “v2.4.5”.  This is not a control, it’s information that you should include if you ever have occasion to fill out a [support request form](https://forms.gle/GE9BjX6MPMi8kTkFA).

## User Profiles

The combination of your name, your list of created conversations for whispering ([see below](#whisper-conversations)), your list of conversations you have listened to previously ([see below](#listen-conversations)),  your favorite phrases ([see below](#favorites)), and your app settings ([see below](#settings)) is called your *user profile*. If you use multiple devices and would like to have the same profile on all of them, just hit the “Profile Sharing” button on the Whisper start screen. This will allow you to share the profile currently on your device with other devices, or to receive an already-shared profile on your current device. Once you have shared a profile among multiple devices, changes you make on any one of the devices will show up on all the others, so that the shared profile stays “in sync” on all of them.

### Whisper Conversations

The Whisper app allows Whisperers to create as many different conversations as they would like, and to pick any of them as the default conversation. To manage your conversations, long-press the Whisper button on the Home Screen: this will bring up the Whisper Conversations window that lists all of your created conversations (in alphabetical order).  In the upper right of this window, there is a + button for creating a new conversation, and an edit button for deleting conversations. Next to each conversation is a “mouth” icon: clicking that icon will start a whisper session for that conversation.

Clicking on a conversation in the Whisper Conversations window brings up a Conversation Details view. In this view, you can edit the name of the conversation, choose it as your *default* conversation (which will start if you tap on the Whisper button in the Home Screen), and get a “Listen link” for the conversation which you can send to your listeners (e.g., in a calendar invite).

Next, if you have turned on automatic transcription of your conversations (see [Whisperer Settings](#whisperer-settings)), this view offers you a list of your conversation’s transcripts from the last month. If you have not turned on automatic transcription, this view offers a button to turn it on.

Finally, at the bottom of the Conversation Details view there is a list of all the listeners that you have already admitted into this conversation. Next to each of them there is a “Delete” button that allows you to remove them from the list.  If you do so, and they try to join the conversation in future, you will be asked if you want to accept them.

### Listen Conversations

The Whisper app keeps track of every conversation a Listener has ever been admitted to. To see this history, long-press the Listen button: this will bring up a screen that lists all of your admitted conversations (with the most recently used on top). From this screen, you can rejoin any of the conversations simply by clicking the ear icon next to the conversation name. You can also share the link to this conversation with other potential listeners by clicking the share icon next to the name. Finally, you can tell the app to forget about this conversation by clicking the delete icon next to the name. Once you have deleted a conversation, if you ever want to rejoin it, you will need someone to send you a listen link for it, and you will be asked if you want to accept entry into the conversation.

If you receive a listen link from someone but clicking on that link doesn’t automatically open the conversation in the Whisper app (e.g., nothing might happen, or the conversation might open in your browser), you can use the ‘+’ button in the upper right of the Listen Conversations window to open that link.  First copy the link, and then hit the ‘+’ button: that should start listening.  If it doesn’t, try pasting the link into the text area that appears and hit the “Join” button at the bottom. It will either join the conversation or tell you that something is wrong with the link.

## Favorites

The Whisper app allows you to save “favorite phrases” so that, when Whispering, you can “say” those phrases simply by pressing a button. This is a very handy feature, especially when you are using Whisper in a context where not everyone can see (or wait for) your typing.  The Favorites feature shows up in a number of different places in the application, but all of them are described in this section.

### Edit Favorites Window

There is an Edit Favorites window in which you can create, delete, and edit all your favorites, and collect them into groups.  You can get to the Edit Favorites window from two places:

- In the home screen of the application, there is a “Favorites” button that will bring up the window.
- In the whisper screen, there is a Favorites (aka “star”) button which, when long-pressed, brings up a menu.  If you choose “Edit Favorites” from this menu, then the Edit Favorites window appears.

When you first bring up the Edit Favorites window, you will see a list of all of your favorites. (When the app starts up, it creates a sample favorite to get you started.) Clicking on one of the favorites in this list will switch you to an editing window where you can change the name and text of the favorite, and where you can put it into one or more of your groups (by checking the box next to the group name).

In the upper right of the Edit Favorites window, you will see button to add a new favorite, edit the existing list of favorites, and to create/edit Groups of favorites.  If you hit the “Groups” button, you will be taken to a window that shows you all your groups of favorites (none to begin with), and in the upper right of that window are buttons to create a new group or edit the list of groups.  Once you create a group, it will appear in that list, and you can click on it to edit the group name and/or to add favorites to the group (by clicking the checkbox next to the favorite). You can place favorites into any number of groups you create.

### Use Favorites Window

When you are whispering, there is a Favorites (aka “star”) button in the [Whisperer controls](#whisperer-controls) at the top of the window. When you tap this button, it makes a “Use Favorites” window appear: on an iPhone, it replaces the past text window; on an iPad or a Mac, it appears to the right of the past text window. The Favorites button shows an empty star when the Use Favorites window is hidden; it shows a filled star when the Use Favorites window is showing.

The Use Favorites window shows the list of favorites in one group.  (To begin with, it shows all your favorites, but if you press and hold on the Favorites button a menu will pop up from which you can pick the group you want shown.) Tapping the name of a favorite will insert that favorite’s text into the past text window (and speak it, if speaking is turned on), exactly as if you had typed that favorite’s text and hit return. You can tap a favorite’s name at any time, even in the middle of typing something else: what you have typed in the live text window will not be disturbed.

## Settings ##

On both the macOS app and the iOS app, you'll find a Settings button on the start screen. When you click that, you'll be presented with a list of options that let you control how the app behaves; the options are displayed in a window on macOS and as a page in the Settings app on iOS.

### iOS-Only Settings

On iOS, but not MacOS, the first group of settings, "Allow Whisper to Access," is an Apple-generated list of options for how the app interacts with other features on your device:

* **Bluetooth** — When an internet connection is not available, Whisper will try to use Bluetooth to connect Listeners with nearby Whisperers. This can be very useful in public places where internet is spotty or unavailable.
* **Siri & Search** — Whisper is not integrated with Siri in any way, so the only thing this affects is whether you can find the app using Siri & Search.
* **Notifications** — Whisper uses notifications to alert Listeners when the app is in the background and the Whisperer is trying to get their attention.
* **Background App Refresh** — Whisper doesn’t do background app refresh, so this setting has no effect.
* **Cellular Data** — This option, which only appears if your device supports cellular data connections, controls whether Whisper can use the internet when not connected to wifi. Whisper conversations use very little data, so leaving this setting on is very unlikely to affect your cellular cost.
* **Paste from Other Apps** — Because Whisper allows you to paste text into the whisper window, and also allows you to paste Listen links, this setting controls whether Whisper is allowed to paste text from other apps. It is recommended that you set it to “Allow” rather than “Ask” or “Deny”.

### iOS and MacOS Settings

On iOS, the rest of the settings have a heading of “Whisper Settings.” On MacOS, the window that contains all the settings is called “Whisper Settings.” In both cases, the following groups of settings are offered:

#### Whisperer Settings

This group offers the following options:

* **Tap on Whisper to** — This controls what a single tap on the Whisper button does if you have created multiple conversations. (If you just have one, a single tap will always start that conversation.) It has three possible settings:
  * **show conversations** — a single tap will bring up the list of all your created conversations so you can choose one to listen to. This is the default setting.
  * **start default conversation** — a single tap will start your default conversation.
  * **start last-used conversation** — a single tap will start the your most recently used Whisper conversation.

* **Auto-transcribe Whisper text?** — this switch controls whether Whisperers can share transcripts of what they said with their Listeners. If you turn this on, all your Whispered conversations are saved on the Whisper server for one month, so you can decide whether you want to share a transcript with someone. (If you share a transcript, the recipient will be able to view it for up to one year.) This feature can be very useful if, for example, you explain an idea to one of your Listeners, and later decide you want to share that description with them or someone else. If you leave transcripts off, then everything you whisper can never be seen again once the conversation ends.
* **Interjection Prefix** — As described under [Whisperer Controls](#whisperer-controls) below, the interjection button allows you to “interrupt yourself” in the middle of typing something. This setting controls whether such an interjection is prefixed by special text to make clear what’s going on. For example, one user starts their interjections with “Please wait while I type” to stop users who are interrupting them.
* **Interjection Alert** — This controls whether a sound is played to get the attention of Listeners when you start an interjection.
* **History Buttons** — In the “past text” window, this setting controls which of the following buttons (described under [Whisperer Controls](#whisperer-controls)) appears on each line:
  * **Repeat** — retypes the contents of the line as the most recent line of past text.
  * **Interject** — starts an interjection with the contents of the line.
  * **Favorite** — Creates a favorite from the content of the line or, if the line already contained a favorite, brings up an edit window on that favorite.


#### Listener Settings

This group offers the following options:

* **Tap on Listen to** — This controls what a single tap on the Listen button does if you have previously participated in more than one conversation. (If you have only ever participated in one, a single tap will always rejoin that conversation.) It has three possible settings:
  * **show conversations** — a single tap will bring up the list of all the conversations you have previously joined so you can choose one to listen to. This is the default setting.
  * **listen to last-used conversation** — a single tap will rejoin the conversation you most recently listened to.
* **Listener sees newest whisper in** — By default, when listening, the Whisperer’s live typing appears in the bottom part of the screen and the Whisperer’s past typing appears in the top part of the screen, with the most recently typed item on the bottom (much like a messaging app). This setting allows you to reverse this layout, so that the live typing is on the top and past typing is on the bottom, with the most recently typed item on the top.

#### ElevenLabs Speech Generation Settings

The final section of settings on both iOS and MacOS control how Whisper generates speech when users choose to read whispered text out loud (see [here](#whisperer-controls) and [here](#listener-controls) for details). By default, Whisper uses Apple’s built-in speech generation technology. Users with an [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) account can opt instead to use that technology by filling in values for the options in this section:

* **API Key** — This is a very long string of lower-case letters and numbers (typically starting with `sk_`) that is issued by ElevenLabs on your request. This value is required in order to use ElevenLabs speech generation.
* **Voice ID** — This is a string of upper- and lower-case numbers and letters that identify the ElevenLabs voice you would like to use to read whispered text.  This is *not* the name of the voice as displayed in the ElevenLabs UI. (For example, the ElevenLabs free voice named “Daniel” has the voice ID `CYw3kZ02Hs0563khs1Fj`.) This value is required in order to use ElevenLabs speech generation.
* **Pronunciation Dictionary ID** — This value is optional and only used if you have created a custom dictionary for word pronunciation via the ElevenLabs API.
* **Pronunciation Dictionary Version** — This value is optional and only used if you have created a custom dictionary for word pronunciation via the ElevenLabs API.
* **Latency Reduction** — Users who have generated a custom voice using the ElevenLabs tools may want to adjust this setting.  It has no effect if used with any of the free ElevenLabs voices.

Full documentation on these settings, including how to apply for and receive your API key, and how to find the Voice ID for a given voice, can be found on the [ElevenLabs site](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech). 

## Controls

While you are whispering or listening, you will see a number of controls along the top of the window.  Some of these take action during the session, while others determine the behavior of the application during the session.  Whenever you finish a session, the app remembers the state of these controls for your next session.

### Whisperer Controls ###

From left to right on the screen, the Whisperer controls are:

* *Alert Listeners*: This button, when clicked by the Whisperer, makes a noise on every Listener’s device. By default, the button looks like <img src="img/bicycle-horn.png" alt="bicycle-horn" style="zoom: 33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> and the default alert sound is a bicycle horn. But if the Whisperer long presses the button, it will pop up a menu offering two other choices: an air horn <img src="img/air-horn.png" alt="air-horn" style="zoom:33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> and a bicycle bell <img src="img/bicycle-bell.png" alt="bicycle-bell" style="zoom:33%;vertical-align:middle;" />. The Whisperer’s choice is then remembered and used until the next long-press.

* *Read Aloud*: This button (shown as <img src="img/read-aloud-on.png" alt="read-aloud-on" style="zoom: 33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> when on and <img src="img/read-aloud-off.png" alt="read-aloud-off" style="zoom:33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> when off) controls an on/off option. When on, each line of whispered text will be read out loud when the Whisperer hits the return key.

* *Repeat*: This button looks like <img src="img/repeat-speech-square.png" alt="repeat" style="zoom: 33%;vertical-align:middle;" />. When the Whisperer clicks it, the app repeats to Listeners the most recently whispered non-blank line of text.  The current live text is not affected. If any Whisperer or Listener has *Read Aloud* is turned on, the repeated text will be read to them.

* *Interject*: This button starts off looking like <img src="img/interjection-off.png" alt="Start Interjection" style="zoom: 33%;vertical-align:middle;" />. The Whisperer clicks it to “start an interjection,” at which point the following things happen:

  * The button changes to look like <img src="img/interjection-on.png" alt="Finish Interjection" style="zoom: 33%;vertical-align:middle;" />.
  * The current live text is cleared (but remembered by the application).
  * The Whisperer’s live text area gets a very thick outline.
  * The live text is set to the text (if any) of the [“Interjection Prefix” setting](#whisperer-settings).
  * Listeners hear the sound (if any) specified in the [“Interjection Alert” setting](#whisperer-settings).

  At this point, the Whisperer types their interjection, which they complete it by clicking the <img src="img/interjection-on.png" alt="Finish Interjection" style="zoom: 33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> button or hitting the return key. When they complete their interjection, the following things happen:

  * The interjected text moves from the live text area to the past text area (and is read for any users that have turned on *Read Aloud*).
  * The app restores the usual thin outline to the Whisperer’s live text area.
  * The app restores the live text that was saved when the Whisperer started the interjection.

* *Favorites*: This button starts off looking like <img src="img/favorite-off.png" alt="Start Interjection" style="zoom: 33%;vertical-align:middle;" />. When tapped, it opens the Use Favorites window ([see above](#favorites)), and changes to look like <img src="img/favorite-on.png" alt="Start Interjection" style="zoom: 33%;vertical-align:middle;" />. Tapping it again closes the Use Favorites window. Long-pressing this button brings up a menu of favorites groups and a button which opens the Edit Favorites widow.  See the section on [Favorites](#favorites) for full details.

* *Font Size*: Whisper offers 8 font sizes for use in the Whisper screen: a group of 4 “small” sizes and a group of 4 “large” sizes. To move down or up in a given range, the Whisperer clicks the <img src="img/font-down.png" alt="font-down" style="zoom:33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> or <img src="img/font-up.png" alt="font-up" style="zoom:33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> button. To shift between ranges, the Whisperer toggles this switch <img src="img/large-sizes.png" alt="large-sizes" style="zoom:33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> on or off.

* *Stop Whispering*: This button is clicked by the Whisperer to end the whisper session. To prevent accidental stops, clicking the button brings up an alert with three choices: *Stop*, *Don’t Stop*, and *Change Device*. Choosing *Stop* will end the Whisper session and tell all the Listeners that the session has ended. Choosing *Don’t Stop* leaves the session in place. Choosing *Change Device* stops the session but allows Whisperers with shared profiles to resume the session on a new device. It tells Listeners that, although the session has stopped, they should start listening again immediately in order to connect to the Whisperer on the next device.

Because iPhones have less available screen space than other devices, there are fewer Whisperer settings available (all the font size controls are removed) and the *Stop Whispering* button has its name shortened to *Stop*. 

### Listener Controls ###

From left to right on the screen, the Listener controls are:

* *Typing Sounds*. This button (shown as <img src="img/typing-on.png" alt="Start Interjection" style="zoom: 33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> when on and <img src="img/typing-off.png" alt="Start Interjection" style="zoom: 33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> when off) controls whether an old-fashioned typewriter sound is played while the Whisperer is typing. (This sound makes it much easier for Listeners to know when they should look at the screen, and when they should avoid interrupting the Whisperer by talking.) Long-pressing this button brings up a menu that allows you to choose one of three volume levels for the typing sound. These levels are relative to the overall volume of your device.
* *Read Aloud*: This button (shown as <img src="img/read-aloud-on.png" alt="read-aloud-on" style="zoom: 33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> when on and <img src="img/read-aloud-off.png" alt="read-aloud-off" style="zoom:33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> when off) controls an on/off option. When on, each line of whispered text will be read out loud when the Whisperer hits the return key.
* *Font Size*: Whisper offers 8 font sizes for use in the Listen screen: a group of 4 “small” sizes and a group of 4 “large” sizes. To move down or up in a given range, click the <img src="img/font-down.png" alt="font-down" style="zoom:33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> or <img src="img/font-up.png" alt="font-up" style="zoom:33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> button. To shift between ranges, toggle this switch <img src="img/large-sizes.png" alt="large-sizes" style="zoom:33%;vertical-align:middle;" /> on or off.
* *Stop Listening*: This button is clicked by the Listener to stop listening to the conversation. (It does not end the conversation for the Whisperer or other Listeners.) To prevent accidental stops, clicking the button brings up an alert with two choices: *Stop* or *Don’t Stop*.

Because iPhones have less available screen space than other devices, there are fewer Listener settings available (the Large Sizes toggle switch is removed) and the Stop Listening button has its name shortened to Stop.

## Uninstalling

### Uninstall the app from an iPhone or iPad

From the home screen or your App Library, press and hold the Whisper app icon. A pop up reading *Remove "Whisper"*? will appear with three options. Choose the first option, "Delete App." At that point, an alert will appear warning you that deleting the app will also delete its data. Choose "Delete" to fully uninstall the app and remove your preferences, including your name.

### Uninstall the app from a Mac

Open Finder and go to your Applications folder. Find Whisper in your list of Applications and drag it to the Trash. This will uninstall the app but not remove your preferences. To delete your preferences, you will need to go into the (hidden) `Library` folder in your home folder, look for a folder named `Containers`, go into that folder, and delete the sub-folder named `Whisper`.
