# Instructions

The Whisper app is available through the App Store on both iOS and macOS. You must have the app in order to *whisper*. It's possible to *listen* on any device with a web browser (see [below](#via-link)).

NOTE: there can only be one Whisperer in each conversation, but there is no limit on Listeners.

## Quick Start (app) ##

On your Apple device (iOS or macOS), follow these steps:

1. Install Whisper from the app store
2. Launch Whisper on your device
3. Allow the app to use Bluetooth
4. Enter your name (you can choose whether the app remembers your name in [Settings](#settings))
5. You can now either [whisper](#how-to-whisper) or [listen](#how-to-listen)

## How to Whisper ##

After following the steps in [Quick Start](#quick-start-app) above:

1. Click the Whisper button
2. OPTIONAL: change your Whisperer settings ([see below](#whisperer-settings)).
3. Nearby (Bluetooth) Listeners can join your conversation automatically (in person) by pressing their Listen button. To invite internet Listeners with a link, click the *Send Listen Link* button.
   * On iPhone, the button looks like this:<br /> <img src="./phone-share-link.png" alt="iPhone Share Link" style="zoom: 40%;" />
   * On iPad or macOS, the button looks like this:<br />
     <img src="./pad-share-link.png" alt="pad-share-link" style="zoom: 26%;" />
4. You're ready to go!
### Tips for whispering:

* Listeners will only be able to read whispers sent *after* they join. Listeners who join later will not see any of the prior conversation.
* When whispering in person, you don't necessarily need Listeners to connect via their devices. You can simply turn on "Read aloud" on your screen and the Listener(s) will hear your whispers whenever you type the return key.
* To repeat yourself, you can copy and paste from your previous whispers.
* You can change your [Whisperer settings](#whisperer-settings) at any point during the conversation.

## How to Listen ##

### via Bluetooth

Bluetooth listening is only available to those using the app. When you are in person with the Whisperer, your app will connect to their conversation automatically over Bluetooth. If there is more than one Whisperer near you, you will be asked to choose which conversation you are joining.

After following the steps in [Quick Start](#quick-start-app) above:

1. Click the Listen button
2. OPTIONAL: change your Listener settings ([see below](#listener-settings)).
3. You're ready to go!

### via Link

1. Wait to receive a link (also known as a URL) from the Whisperer over text, email, or any other messaging format.

2. Click the link to open it:

   * If you have the app it will automatically put you in that conversation in the app.

   * If you don't have the app, the link will open in your browser and automatically put you in the conversation. If this is the first time you've listened via browser, you may be prompted to enter your name before you can join.

3. You're ready to go!

### Tips for listening: ###

1. Whisper is designed for conversations where everyone can hear, so you can speak aloud as normal. 
2. Be a good listener! Make sure to read everything the Whisperer sends so you're sure of what they're saying.
3. Don't speak *over* the Whisperer. Even though they're typing and you're using your voice, you're still interrupting if you talk while they're talking. Remember: hearing people are wired to pay attention to spoken words. That means that, even with the best intentions on all sides, you will naturally drown out the Whisperer by interrupting aloud.
4. The average person can speak aloud a lot faster than they can type (especially if the typist has physical restrictions!). Remind yourself that this affects the pace of the conversation. It may feel a little awkward (at least at first), but that's okayâ€”awkwardness happens! And it's a very minor price to pay for being able to have full conversations with the Whisperer(s) in your life.
5. It might make the most sense in some situations for the Whisperer to have their device read their contributions aloud, so be ready to listen with your eyes, your ears, or both as needed.

## Settings ##

### App Settings ###

On both the macOS and the iOS app, you'll find a Settings button on the start screen. When you click that, you'll be presented with a menu of options that let you control how the app behaves; the menu is displayed as a pop-up window on computers and as a page in the Settings app on iOS devices. (In iOS, you will also see an Apple-generated menu called "Allow Whisper to Access," which controls how Whisper interacts with other features of your device.)
