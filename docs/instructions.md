# Instructions

The Whisper app is available through the App Store[\*\*](./index.md#acknowledgements) on both iOS and macOS. You must have the app in order to *whisper*. It's possible to *listen* on any device with a web browser (see [below](#via-link)).

## Quick Start (app) ##

On your Apple device (iOS or macOS), follow these steps:

1. Install Whisper from the App Store.
2. Launch Whisper on your device.
3. Allow the app to use Bluetooth.
4. Enter your name and tap the "done" key (iOS) or the return key (macOS)
5. Two new buttons will appear: [Whisper](#how-to-whisper) and [Listen](#how-to-listen); your app is now set up and you can use either function.

## How to Whisper ##

After following the steps in [Quick Start](#quick-start-app) above:

1. Click the Whisper button
2. In the Whisper window, hit the button to share a link with your Listeners.  This button looks like <img src="img/phone-share-link.png" alt="phone-share-link" style="zoom: 33%;" /> on an iPhone and like <img src="img/pad-share-link.png" alt="pad-share-link" style="zoom: 20%;" /> on an iPad or computer.
3. Use the share dialog that appears to send the link to someone (or multiple people) you would like to join the conversation, and have the recipients click on that link. (NOTE: Whenever one of your recipients listens via a link *for the first time*, you will get prompted to accept them into the conversation.  Once you accept them, they are accepted for all time, and they will be able to see what you type.)
4. Start whispering, er, typing! (When you’re ready to stop, hit the Stop button in the upper right of the screen.)

The steps above use your *default* conversation, which is created when you first use the app and given the name “Conversation 1.”  To create, rename, or delete your conversations, or to choose a different conversation to start, long-press on the Whisper button.  This will bring up a window that shows all your conversations and allows you to manage them.  Next to each conversation there is a mouth icon; click on the icon for the conversation you wish to start.

Each conversation keeps track of which Listeners you have previously approved to join it, and will let them back in without prompting you. Accepting a listener to one conversation does *not* accept the listener to any other conversations: you will always be prompted to accept when a Listener joins any conversation for the first time.

### Tips for whispering:

* Listeners will only be able to read whispers sent *after* they join. Listeners who join later will not see any of the prior conversation.
* You can change your [Whisperer settings](#whisperer-settings) at any point during the conversation.  Any settings you change will be remembered and used the next time you start a conversation.
* When whispering to people very near you, you don't necessarily need them to connect via their devices. You can simply turn on the [*read-aloud*](#read-aloud-whisper-option) Whisperer setting and the Listener(s) will hear your whispers whenever you type the return key.

## How to Listen ##

After following the steps in [Quick Start](#quick-start-app) above, there are three ways to join a conversation:

### via Received Link

1. Wait to receive a link (also known as a URL) from the Whisperer over text, email, AirDrop, or any other messaging format.
2. Click the link to open it:

   * If you have the app, you will automatically join that conversation in the app.  If this is the very first time you have tried to join that conversation, you will first be shown the conversation name and the Whisperer’s name and asked if you want to join.

   * If you don't have the app, the link will open in your browser. You will be prompted with the conversation name and the Whisperer’s name and asked to confirm that you want to join the conversation.
3. Start listening, er, reading! (When you’re ready to stop, hit the Stop button in the upper right of the screen.)

### via Remembered Link (in-app only)

1. Long press on the *Whisper* button.  This will bring up a window showing all the conversations that you have ever joined, most-recently joined first.
2. Tap on the ear icon next to a conversation to join that conversation.
3. Start listening, er, reading! (When you’re ready to stop, hit the Stop button in the upper right of the screen.)

### via Bluetooth Discovery (in-app only)

The app can use Bluetooth to discover any ongoing conversations near you that you have previously joined.  If you know there is such a conversation going on:

1. Click the Listen button
2. Wait for the app to discover the nearby Whisperer and conversation.
3. Start listening, er, reading! (When you’re ready to stop, hit the Stop button in the upper right of the screen.)

### Tips for listening: ###

1. Whisper is designed for conversations where everyone can hear, so you can speak aloud as normal. 
2. Be a good listener! Make sure to read everything the Whisperer sends so you're sure of what they're saying.
3. Don't speak *over* the Whisperer. Even though they're typing and you're using your voice, you're still interrupting if you talk while they're talking. Remember: hearing people are wired to pay attention to spoken words. That means that, even with the best intentions on all sides, you will naturally drown out the Whisperer by interrupting aloud.
4. The average person can speak aloud a lot faster than they can type (especially if the typist has physical restrictions). Remind yourself that this affects the pace of the conversation. It may feel a little awkward (at least at first), but that's okay—awkwardness happens! And it's a very minor price to pay for being able to have full conversations with the Whisperer(s) in your life.
5. It might make the most sense in some situations (e.g., if you have to be looking elsewhere) for your device to read what the Whisperer says. You can change your [read-aloud](#read-aloud-listen-option) Listener setting at any time, and it will be remembered for the next time you listen.

## User Profiles

The app allows Whisperers to create as many different conversations as they would like, and to pick any of them as the default conversation (started by clicking on the Whisper button).  To manage your conversations, long-press the Whisper button: this will bring up a screen that lists all of your created conversations, and provides controls for creating, deleting, renaming, and choosing one as the default. (It also allows removing previously admitted listeners from a conversation.)  Once you are in this screen, you can easily start a Whisper session for any conversation: click the mouth icon next to it.

The app keeps track of every conversation a Listener has ever been admitted to.  To see this history, long-press the Listen button: this will bring up a screen that lists all of your admitted conversations (with the most recently used on top).  From this screen, you can also rejoin any of the conversations simply by clicking the ear icon next to the conversation name.

The combination of your name, your list of created conversations for whispering, and your list of admitted conversations for listening is called your *user profile*.  If you own multiple devices and would like to have the same profile on all of them, just hit the “Profile Sharing” button on the Whisper home screen.  This will allow you both to share the profile currently on your device with other devices, and to receive a profile shared from one device on another device.

Once you have shared a profile among multiple devices, changes you make on any one of the devices will show up on all the others, so that the shared profile stays “in sync” on all of them.

## Settings ##

### App Settings ###

On both the macOS and the iOS app, you'll find a Settings button on the start screen. When you click that, you'll be presented with a menu of options that let you control how the app behaves; the menu is displayed as a pop-up window on computers and as a page in the Settings app on iOS devices. (In iOS, you will also see an Apple-generated menu called "Allow Whisper to Access," which controls how Whisper interacts with other features of your device.)

#### iOS

To access the app settings on iOS, tap the Settings button on the start screen. You will be automatically redirected to the Whisper section of your device's Settings app, which contains two lists of options. The first, "Allow Whisper to Access," is an Apple-generated list of options for how the app interacts with other features on your device. The second, "Whisper Settings," is what lets you control how the app itself behaves. 

**Allow Whisper to Access** has the following sections:

* **Bluetooth** — Whisper uses Bluetooth when the Whisperer is close to you. This means you need not have an internet connection to listen to a nearby Whisperer.  This can be very useful in public places where internet is spotty or unavailable.  Using Bluetooth also allows you to [discover nearby conversations](#via-bluetooth-discovery-in-app-only).
* **Siri & Search** — Whisper is not integrated with Siri in any way, so the only thing this affects is whether you can find the app using Siri & Search.
* **Notifications** — Whisper uses notifications to alert Listeners when the app is in the background and the Whisperer is trying to get their attention.

 Your **Whisper Settings** area has two sections.  The first section has just one option:

* **Listener sees newest whisper in** — By default, when listening, the Whisperer’s live typing appears in the top part of the screen and the Whisperer’s past typing appears in the bottom part of the screen, with the most recently typed item on top.  This setting allows you to reverse this layout, so that the live typing is on the bottom and past typing is on top, with the most recently typed item on the bottom (much like a messaging app).

The second section provides an alternative to Whisper’s default use of Apple’s built-in Siri-based reading of whispered text. Users with an [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) account can use one of their many provided voices, or a custom voice developed by the user, to read the texts instead.  Documentation on the required settings (API key, voice ID, and latency reduction) can be found [here](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech).

#### macOS

To change your general settings for the Whisper app, click the Settings button on the start screen. A window titled "Whisper Settings" will appear two sections.  The first section has just one option:

* **Listener sees newest whisper in** — By default, when listening, the Whisperer’s live typing appears in the top part of the screen and the Whisperer’s past typing appears in the bottom part of the screen, with the most recently typed item on top.  This setting allows you to reverse this layout, so that the live typing is on the bottom and past typing is on top, with the most recently typed item on the bottom (much like a messaging app).

The second section provides an alternative to Whisper’s default use of Apple’s built-in Siri-based reading of whispered text. Users with an [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) account can use one of their many provided voices, or a custom voice developed by the user, to read the texts instead.  Documentation on the required settings (API key, voice ID, and latency reduction) can be found [here](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech).

### Whisperer Settings ###

Once you are in the Whisper screen, you will see a number of controls along the top of the window. These control behavior of the Whisper interface, and are remembered between sessions. Each control is marked with an icon.  From left to right on the screen, they are:

* *Alert Listeners*: This button, when clicked by the Whisperer, makes a noise on every Listener’s device.  By default, the button looks like <img src="img/bicycle-horn.png" alt="bicycle-horn" style="zoom: 33%;" /> and the default alert sound is a bicycle horn. But if the Whisperer long presses the button, it will pop up a menu offering two other choices: an air horn <img src="img/air-horn.png" alt="air-horn" style="zoom:33%;" /> and a bicycle bell <img src="img/bicycle-bell.png" alt="bicycle-bell" style="zoom:33%;" />. The Whisperer’s choice is then remembered and used until the next long-press.
* *Read Aloud*: <a id="read-aloud-whisper-option">This button (shown as <img src="img/read-aloud-on.png" alt="read-aloud-on" style="zoom: 33%;" /> when on and <img src="img/read-aloud-off.png" alt="read-aloud-off" style="zoom:33%;" /> when off) controls an on/off option. When on, each line of whispered text will be read out loud when the Whisperer hits the return key.
* *Font Size*: Whisper offers 10 font sizes for use in the Whisper screen: a group of 5 “small” sizes and a group of 5 “large” sizes.  To move down or up in a given range, the Whisperer clicks the <img src="img/font-down.png" alt="font-down" style="zoom:33%;" /> or <img src="img/font-up.png" alt="font-up" style="zoom:33%;" /> button.  To shift between ranges, the Whisperer toggles this switch <img src="img/large-sizes.png" alt="large-sizes" style="zoom:33%;" /> on or off.
* *Stop Whispering*: This button is clicked by the Whisperer to end the whisper session.  To prevent accidental stops, clicking the button brings up an alert with two choices: Stop or Don’t Stop.

Because iPhones have less available screen space than other devices, there are fewer Whisperer settings available (all the font size controls are removed) and the Stop Whispering button has its name shortened to Stop. 

### Listener Settings ###

Once you are in the Listen screen, you will see a number of controls along the top of the window. These control the behavior of the Listen interface, and are remembered between sessions. Each control is marked with an icon.  From left to right on the screen, they are:

* *Read Aloud*: <a id="read-aloud-listen-option">This button (shown as <img src="img/read-aloud-on.png" alt="read-aloud-on" style="zoom: 33%;" /> when on and <img src="img/read-aloud-off.png" alt="read-aloud-off" style="zoom:33%;" /> when off) controls an on/off option. When on, each line of whispered text will be read out loud when the Whisperer hits the return key.
* *Font Size*: Whisper offers 10 font sizes for use in the Listen screen: a group of 5 “small” sizes and a group of 5 “large” sizes.  To move down or up in a given range, the Whisperer clicks the <img src="img/font-down.png" alt="font-down" style="zoom:33%;" /> or <img src="img/font-up.png" alt="font-up" style="zoom:33%;" /> button.  To shift between ranges, the Listener toggles this switch <img src="img/large-sizes.png" alt="large-sizes" style="zoom:33%;" /> on or off.
* *Stop Listening*: This button is clicked by the Listener to end the listen session.  To prevent accidental stops, clicking the button brings up an alert with two choices: Stop or Don’t Stop.

Because iPhones have less available screen space than other devices, there are fewer Listener settings available (the Large Sizes toggle switch is removed) and the Stop Listening button has its name shortened to Stop.

## Uninstalling

### Uninstall the app from an iPhone or iPad

From the home screen or your App Library, press and hold the Whisper app icon. A pop up reading *Remove "Whisper"*? will appear with three options. Choose the first option, "Delete App." At that point, an alert will appear warning you that deleting the app will also delete its data. Choose "Delete" to fully uninstall the app and remove your preferences, including your name.

### Uninstall the app from an Apple computer

Open Finder and go to your Applications folder. Find Whisper in your list of Applications and drag it to the Trash. This will uninstall the app but not remove your preferences. To delete your preferences, you will need to go into the (hidden) `Library` folder in your home folder, look for a folder named `Containers`, go into that folder, and delete the sub-folder named `Whisper`.
