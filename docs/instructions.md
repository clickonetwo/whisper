# Instructions

The Whisper app is available through the App Store[\*\*](./index.md#acknowledgements) on both iOS and macOS. You must have the app in order to *whisper*. It's possible to *listen* on any device with a web browser (see [below](#via-received-link)).

## Quick Start ##

On your Apple device (iOS or macOS), follow these steps:

1. Install Whisper from the App Store.
2. Launch Whisper on your device.
3. Allow the app to use Bluetooth.
4. Enter your name and tap the "done" key (iOS) or the return key (macOS)
5. Two new buttons will appear: [Whisper](#how-to-whisper) and [Listen](#how-to-listen); your app is now set up and you can use either function.

## How to Whisper ##

After following the steps in [Quick Start](#quick-start) above:

1. Click the Whisper button
2. In the Whisper window, hit the button to share a link with your Listeners. This button looks like <img src="img/phone-share-link.png" alt="phone-share-link" style="zoom: 33%;" /> on an iPhone and like <img src="img/pad-share-link.png" alt="pad-share-link" style="zoom: 20%;" /> on an iPad or computer.
3. Use the share dialog that appears to send the link to someone (or multiple people) you would like to join the conversation, and have the recipients click on that link. (NOTE: Whenever one of your recipients listens via a link *for the first time*, you will get prompted to accept them into the conversation. Once you accept them, they are accepted for all time, and they will be able to see what you type.)
4. Start whispering, er, typing! (When you’re ready to stop, hit the Stop button in the upper right of the screen.)

The steps above use your *default* conversation, which is created when you first use the app and given the name “Conversation 1.” To create, rename, or delete your conversations, or to choose a different conversation to start, long-press on the Whisper button. This will bring up a window that shows all your conversations and allows you to manage them. Next to each conversation there is a mouth icon; click on the icon for the conversation you wish to start.

Each conversation keeps track of which Listeners you have previously approved to join it, and will let them back in without prompting you. Accepting a listener to one conversation does *not* accept the listener to any other conversations: you will always be prompted to accept when a Listener joins any conversation for the first time.

### Tips for whispering:

* Listeners will only be able to read whispers sent *after* they join. Listeners who join later will not see any of the prior conversation.
* You can change your [Whisperer settings](#whisperer-settings) at any point during the conversation. Any settings you change will be remembered and used the next time you start a conversation.
* When whispering to people very near you, you don't necessarily need them to connect via their devices. You can simply turn on the [*read-aloud*](#read-aloud-whisper-option) Whisperer setting and the Listener(s) will hear your whispers whenever you type the return key.

## How to Listen ##

After following the steps in [Quick Start](#quick-start) above, there are three ways to join a conversation:

### via Received Link

1. Wait to receive a link (also known as a URL) from the Whisperer over text, email, AirDrop, or any other messaging format.
2. Click the link to open it:

   * If you have the app, you will automatically join that conversation in the app. If this is the very first time you have tried to join that conversation, you will first be shown the conversation name and the Whisperer’s name and asked if you want to join.

   * If you don't have the app, the link will open in your browser. You will be prompted with the conversation name and the Whisperer’s name and asked to confirm that you want to join the conversation.
3. Start listening, er, reading! (When you’re ready to stop, hit the Stop button in the upper right of the screen.)

### via Remembered Link (in-app only)

1. Long press on the *Listen* button. This will bring up a window showing all the conversations that you have ever joined, most-recently joined first.
2. Tap on the ear icon next to a conversation to join that conversation.
3. Start listening, er, reading! (When you’re ready to stop, hit the Stop button in the upper right of the screen.)

### Tips for listening: ###

1. Whisper is designed for conversations where everyone can hear, so you can speak aloud as normal. 
2. Be a good listener! Make sure to read everything the Whisperer sends so you're sure of what they're saying.
3. Don't speak *over* the Whisperer. Even though they're typing and you're using your voice, you're still interrupting if you talk while they're talking. Remember: hearing people are wired to pay attention to spoken words. That means that, even with the best intentions on all sides, you will naturally drown out the Whisperer by interrupting aloud.
4. The average person can speak aloud a lot faster than they can type (especially if the typist has physical restrictions). Remind yourself that this affects the pace of the conversation. It may feel a little awkward (at least at first), but that's okay—awkwardness happens! And it's a very minor price to pay for being able to have full conversations with the Whisperer(s) in your life.
5. It might make the most sense in some situations (e.g., if you have to be looking elsewhere) for your device to read what the Whisperer says. You can change your [read-aloud](#read-aloud-listen-option) Listener setting at any time, and it will be remembered for the next time you listen.

## User Profiles

The app allows Whisperers to create as many different conversations as they would like, and to pick any of them as the default conversation. To manage your conversations, long-press the Whisper button: this will bring up a screen that lists all of your created conversations, and provides controls for creating, deleting, renaming, and choosing one as the default. (It also allows removing previously admitted listeners from a conversation.) Once you are in this screen, you can easily start a Whisper session for any conversation: click the mouth icon next to it.

The app keeps track of every conversation a Listener has ever been admitted to. To see this history, long-press the Listen button: this will bring up a screen that lists all of your admitted conversations (with the most recently used on top). From this screen, you can rejoin any of the conversations simply by clicking the ear icon next to the conversation name.

The combination of your name, your list of created conversations for whispering, your list of admitted conversations for listening, and your settings ([see below](#settings)) is called your *user profile*. If you use multiple devices and would like to have the same profile on all of them, just hit the “Profile Sharing” button on the Whisper start screen. This will allow you to share the profile currently on your device with other devices, or to receive an already-shared profile on your current device. Once you have shared a profile among multiple devices, changes you make on any one of the devices will show up on all the others, so that the shared profile stays “in sync” on all of them.

## Settings ##

### App Settings ###

On both the macOS app and the iOS app, you'll find a Settings button on the start screen. When you click that, you'll be presented with a list of options that let you control how the app behaves; the options are displayed in a window on macOS and as a page in the Settings app on iOS.

#### iOS-Only Settings

On iOS, but not MacOS, the first group of settings, "Allow Whisper to Access," is an Apple-generated list of options for how the app interacts with other features on your device:

* **Bluetooth** — When an internet connection is not available, Whisper will try to use Bluetooth to connect Listeners with nearby Whisperers. This can be very useful in public places where internet is spotty or unavailable.
* **Siri & Search** — Whisper is not integrated with Siri in any way, so the only thing this affects is whether you can find the app using Siri & Search.
* **Notifications** — Whisper uses notifications to alert Listeners when the app is in the background and the Whisperer is trying to get their attention.
* **Background App Refresh** — Whisper doesn’t do background app refresh, so this setting has no effect.
* **Cellular Data** — This option, which only appears if your device supports cellular data connections, controls whether Whisper can use the internet when not connected to wifi. Whisper conversations use very little data, so leaving this setting on is very unlikely to affect your cellular cost.

#### iOS and MacOS Settings

On iOS, the next group of settings is called “Whisper Settings.” On MacOS, the window that contains all the settings is called “Whisper Settings.” In both cases, these options are offered:

* **Tap on Whisper to** — This controls what a single tap on the Whisper button does if you have created multiple conversations. (If you just have one, a single tap will always start that conversation.) It has three possible settings:
  * **show conversations** — a single tap will bring up the list of all your created conversations so you can choose one to listen to. This is the default setting.
  * **start default conversation** — a single tap will start your default conversation.
  * **start last-used conversation** — a single tap will start the your most recently used Whisper conversation.

* **Tap on Listen to** — This controls what a single tap on the Listen button does if you have previously participated in more than one conversation. (If you have only ever participated in one, a single tap will always rejoin that conversation.) It has three possible settings:
  * **show conversations** — a single tap will bring up the list of all the conversations you have previously joined so you can choose one to listen to. This is the default setting.
  * **listen to last-used conversation** — a single tap will rejoin the conversation you most recently listened to.
* **Listener sees newest whisper in** — By default, when listening, the Whisperer’s live typing appears in the bottom part of the screen and the Whisperer’s past typing appears in the top part of the screen, with the most recently typed item on the bottom (much like a messaging app). This setting allows you to reverse this layout, so that the live typing is on the top and past typing is on the bottom, with the most recently typed item on the top.

The final section of settings on both iOS and MacOS is called “ElevenLabs Speech Generation.” By default, Whisper uses Apple’s built-in speech generation technology when users choose to read whispered text out loud (see [here](#whisperer-settings) and [here](#listener-settings) for details). Users with an [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) account can opt instead to use use that technology by filling in values for the options in this section. Documentation on the required settings (API key, voice ID, and latency reduction) can be found [here](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech). 

### Whisperer Settings ###

Once you are in the Whisper screen, you will see a number of controls along the top of the window. These control behavior of the Whisper interface, and are remembered between sessions. Each control is marked with an icon. From left to right on the screen, they are:

* *Alert Listeners*: This button, when clicked by the Whisperer, makes a noise on every Listener’s device. By default, the button looks like <img src="img/bicycle-horn.png" alt="bicycle-horn" style="zoom: 33%;" /> and the default alert sound is a bicycle horn. But if the Whisperer long presses the button, it will pop up a menu offering two other choices: an air horn <img src="img/air-horn.png" alt="air-horn" style="zoom:33%;" /> and a bicycle bell <img src="img/bicycle-bell.png" alt="bicycle-bell" style="zoom:33%;" />. The Whisperer’s choice is then remembered and used until the next long-press.
* *Read Aloud*: <a id="read-aloud-whisper-option">This button (shown as <img src="img/read-aloud-on.png" alt="read-aloud-on" style="zoom: 33%;" /> when on and <img src="img/read-aloud-off.png" alt="read-aloud-off" style="zoom:33%;" /> when off) controls an on/off option. When on, each line of whispered text will be read out loud when the Whisperer hits the return key.
* *Font Size*: Whisper offers 10 font sizes for use in the Whisper screen: a group of 5 “small” sizes and a group of 5 “large” sizes. To move down or up in a given range, the Whisperer clicks the <img src="img/font-down.png" alt="font-down" style="zoom:33%;" /> or <img src="img/font-up.png" alt="font-up" style="zoom:33%;" /> button. To shift between ranges, the Whisperer toggles this switch <img src="img/large-sizes.png" alt="large-sizes" style="zoom:33%;" /> on or off.
* *Stop Whispering*: This button is clicked by the Whisperer to end the whisper session. To prevent accidental stops, clicking the button brings up an alert with three choices: *Stop*, *Don’t Stop*, and *Change Device*. Choosing *Stop* will end the Whisper session both and tell all the Listeners that the session has ended. Choosing *Don’t Stop* leaves the session in place. Choosing *Change Device* stops the session but allows users with shared profiles to resume the session on a new device. It tells Listeners that, although the session has stopped, they should start listening again immediately in order to connect to the Whisperer on the next device.

Because iPhones have less available screen space than other devices, there are fewer Whisperer settings available (all the font size controls are removed) and the *Stop Whispering* button has its name shortened to *Stop*. 

### Listener Settings ###

Once you are in the Listen screen, you will see a number of controls along the top of the window. These control the behavior of the Listen interface, and are remembered between sessions. Each control is marked with an icon. From left to right on the screen, they are:

* *Read Aloud*: <a id="read-aloud-listen-option">This button (shown as <img src="img/read-aloud-on.png" alt="read-aloud-on" style="zoom: 33%;" /> when on and <img src="img/read-aloud-off.png" alt="read-aloud-off" style="zoom:33%;" /> when off) controls an on/off option. When on, each line of whispered text will be read out loud when the Whisperer hits the return key.
* *Font Size*: Whisper offers 10 font sizes for use in the Listen screen: a group of 5 “small” sizes and a group of 5 “large” sizes. To move down or up in a given range, the Whisperer clicks the <img src="img/font-down.png" alt="font-down" style="zoom:33%;" /> or <img src="img/font-up.png" alt="font-up" style="zoom:33%;" /> button. To shift between ranges, the Listener toggles this switch <img src="img/large-sizes.png" alt="large-sizes" style="zoom:33%;" /> on or off.
* *Stop Listening*: This button is clicked by the Listener to stop listening to the conversation. (It does not end the conversation for the Whisperer or other Listeners.) To prevent accidental stops, clicking the button brings up an alert with two choices: *Stop* or *Don’t Stop*.

Because iPhones have less available screen space than other devices, there are fewer Listener settings available (the Large Sizes toggle switch is removed) and the Stop Listening button has its name shortened to Stop.

## Uninstalling

### Uninstall the app from an iPhone or iPad

From the home screen or your App Library, press and hold the Whisper app icon. A pop up reading *Remove "Whisper"*? will appear with three options. Choose the first option, "Delete App." At that point, an alert will appear warning you that deleting the app will also delete its data. Choose "Delete" to fully uninstall the app and remove your preferences, including your name.

### Uninstall the app from an Apple computer

Open Finder and go to your Applications folder. Find Whisper in your list of Applications and drag it to the Trash. This will uninstall the app but not remove your preferences. To delete your preferences, you will need to go into the (hidden) `Library` folder in your home folder, look for a folder named `Containers`, go into that folder, and delete the sub-folder named `Whisper`.
