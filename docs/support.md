# Support 

If you have a question about using Whisper, please start by reading the [Instructions](instructions.md) page, and then read through the following FAQ. If that does not answer your question(s), or if you just want to provide us with general feedback, there is a support form at the bottom of this page.

## FAQ

### Do I need an iPhone or iPad to use Whisper? ###

You need an Apple device (iPhone, iPad, or Mac computer) to be the Whisperer, but not to listen. If you don't have an Apple device and want to listen, have the Whisperer send you a link from their app.

To learn how to whisper from the app, see the [instructions page](instructions.md).

To learn how to listen either in the app or in a browser, see the [instructions page](instructions.md).

### If I don't have the app on my device, can I still listen?

Yes, you can still listen using your browser. Just click on the link sent to you by the Whisperer to join the conversation. If this is the first time you've used your browser to listen, you will be prompted to put in your name before joining.

### Why is my browser asking me for my name?

If this is the first time you've used your browser to listen, you will be prompted to put in your name before joining the conversation. If this is NOT the first time you've listened in this browser, it means that your Whisper-related cookies have been cleared since the last time you listened.

### Does Whisper store my conversations?

Nope! The contents of conversations held through Whisper are not stored *anywhere*, even on your local device. See our [Privacy statement](index.md/#privacy) for more information.

### Can I copy and paste text from my conversations?

The Whisperer can copy and paste what they have typed in the app, but Listeners cannot copy any text from the app. (Whisperers should be aware that browser Listeners can copy and paste text from the conversation. If this is undesirable, converse only via Bluetooth.)

## Need More Support? ##

If the answers above have not solved your problem, please contact us through [this form](https://forms.gle/GE9BjX6MPMi8kTkFA) and we will get back to you as soon as we can. Please note that this is a single-developer app, so response times will not be immediate (or maybe not even quick).

At [ClickOneTwo](https://clickonetwo.io), we are firm believers that there are NO stupid questions, especially when it comes to using computers. We want to make Whisper as helpful as possible to everyone, so we truly appreciate your feedback.
