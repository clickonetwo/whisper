**Don't Interrupt Button**/Toggle

If others are speaking over you, you can press the "Don't Interrupt" button at any time. This will display a message to all of your listeners that reads, "[Your name] is whispering. Please wait until [your name] is done to speak."

* **for me: will there be a way to change the message? to send to an individual?** - yes and yes
